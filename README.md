# HTTPS client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of an HTTPS client with PSOC&trade; 6 MCU and AIROC&trade; CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; combo chips.

It employs the [HTTPS client](https://github.com/Infineon/http-client) middleware library, which takes care of all the underlying socket connections with the HTTPS server. In this example, the HTTPS client establishes a secure connection with an HTTPS server through an SSL handshake. After the SSL handshake completes successfully, the HTTPS client can make GET, POST, and PUT requests with the server.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

> **Note:** The PSOC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSOC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

> **Note:** To configure the kit as an HTTPS server, see the [HTTPS server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-https-server) code example readme steps.

## Operation

[HTTPS client](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-https-client) code example needs a server to communicate. To test this code example, build and program another device with [HTTPS server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-https-server) code example to act as an HTTPS server.

If using a PSOC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSOC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

> **Note:** Use `policy_single_CM0_CM4_smif_swap.json` policy instead of using the default one "policy_single_CM0_CM4_swap.json" to provision CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W device.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open *secure_http_client.h* and modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect to

   All possible security types are defined in the `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in the *cy_wcm.h* file

3. Because this code example uses a self-signed SSL certificate, you need to generate the certificates required by the HTTPS server and client so that they can successfully establish a secure HTTPS connection. Follow the steps provided in a [Creating a self-signed SSL certificate](#creating-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate) section that explains how to generate the certificates

4. Open the *source/secure_keys.h* file and do the following:

   1. Modify `keyCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM` with the contents from the *mysecurehttpclient.crt* file generated in **Step 3**
   2. Modify `keyCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` with the contents from the *mysecurehttpclient.key* file generated in **Step 3**
   3. Modify `keySERVER_ROOTCA_PEM` with the contents from the *rootCA.crt* file generated in **Step 3**

5. Open the *source/secure_http_client.h* and modify the `#define HTTPS_SERVER_HOST` macro to match the Server IP address that you want to connect to

6. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

7. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

8. After programming, the application starts automatically. Verify that the following logs appear on the serial terminal:

   ```

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Known issues

An issue has been observed with the multicast domain name system (mDNS) when the device joins the home AP (D-Link DIR-816 and TP-Link Archer C20 APs). To work around this issue, connect the kit to a mobile hotspot if the device reports the following error when joining the AP.

   ```
   Info: Wi-Fi initialization is successful
   Info: Join to AP: WIFI_SSID
   Function whd_wifi_unregister_multicast_address failed at line 2834 checkres = 101580800
   Received buffer request ID: 42 (expectation: 42)
   whd_cdc_send_ioctl is already timed out, drop the buffer
   ```

This issue will be addressed in a future update of this code example.


## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj | UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the Debug UART port


<br>

This example uses the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSOC&trade; 6 MCU to start the HTTPS client task. At device reset, the default Cortex&reg;-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, the HTTPS client establishes a secure connection with a server through an SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, the server presents its SSL certificate for verification and verifies the incoming client's identity.


### Creating a self-signed SSL certificate

The HTTPS client demonstrated in this example uses a self-signed SSL certificate. This requires **OpenSSL** which is already preloaded in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation. A self-signed SSL certificate means that there is no third-party certificate issuing authority, commonly referred to as CA, involved in the authentication of the server. Clients connecting to the server must have a root CA certificate to verify and trust the websites defined by the certificate. Only when the client trusts the website, it establish a secure connection with the HTTPS server.



#### Generate an SSL certificate and private key

Run the following script to generate the self-signed SSL certificate and private key.

Before invoking the following command, modify the `OPENSSL_SUBJECT_INFO` macro in the *generate_ssl_certs.sh* file to match your local domain configuration such as *Country*, *State*, *Locality*, *Organization*, *Organization Unit name*, and *Common Name*. This macro is used by the *openssl* commands when generating the certificate.

```
cd scripts
./generate_ssl_certs.sh
```

This creates the following files:

File                           | Description
-------------------------------|------------
*mysecurehttpclient.crt* | HTTPS client certificate
*mysecurehttpclient.key* | HTTPS client key
*mysecurehttpclient.pfx* | Bundles the HTTPS client certificate and key in PKCS12 format
*rootCA.crt* | HTTPS server rootCA certificate to trust the client
*rootCA.key* | HTTPS server root key used for signing the certificate
*mysecurehttpserver.local.crt* | HTTPS server certificate
*mysecurehttpserver.local.key* | HTTPS server private key

<br>

Configure the HTTPS client to take *mysecurehttpclient.crt* as the certificate, *mysecurehttpclient.key* as the private key, and *rootCA.crt* as the rootCA certificate.

You can either convert the values to strings manually following the format shown in *source/secure_keys.h* or run the _format_cert_key.py_ Python script to generate the string format of the certificate file. Pass the name of the certificate with the extension as an argument to the Python script:

> **Note:** For Linux and macOS platforms, use `python3` instead of `python` in the following command.

  ```
  python format_cert_key.py <one-or-more-file-name-of-certificate-or-key-with-extension>
  ```

  Example:
  ```
  python format_cert_key.py root_ca.crt
  ```

Currently this code example uses the TLS v1.2. To use the TLS v1.3, uncomment the MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_TLS1_3 and FORCE_TLS_VERSION MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_3 defines in the mbedtls_user_config.h file. However, note that the socket receive fails if the application establishes TLS v1.3 connection to a server where session tickets are enabled. This is due to a bug in third-party MBEDTLS library.
